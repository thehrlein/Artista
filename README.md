# Artista

-- This is a short demo application. I is designed to be easily extended with new features --

**Important:** To run this application, you have to set up your personal [LastFm - API Key ](https://www.last.fm/api/authentication) and write it into 'gradle.properties'

This is a sample where I tried dependency injection via dagger, koin and kodein (check branches)

## Features:
- Search for artists
- List artists top albums
- See some basic album information (e.g. tracklist)
- Mark album as favorite (stored locally)
- See all your favorite albums and details even without any network connection

## Librarys and Language:
- Kotlin
- AdapterDelegate
- Android Architecture Components
   * ViewModel (with UseCases)
   * LiveData
   * Room Database
- Coroutines
- Dagger / Koin / Kodein (check branches)
- Glide
- Retrofit
- ...
